This directory contains complete example applications demonstrating Polly's capabilities.

## Examples

### 1. [Elysia Todo App](./elysia-todo-app) - **NEW!** 🎉

**Full-stack web app with Elysia + Bun**

A complete todo application demonstrating Polly's Elysia middleware integration for building distributed web applications.

**Features:**
- Zero type duplication (Eden infers from Elysia)
- Offline-first with automatic queueing
- Real-time sync via WebSocket broadcast
- Route-level authorization
- Declarative client effects
- Production-ready (minimal overhead)

**Great for:**
- Learning how SPAs are distributed systems

### 2. [WebRTC P2P Chat](./webrtc-p2p-chat) - **NEW!** 🎉

**Peer-to-peer chat with WebRTC data channels**

A real-time chat application demonstrating direct browser-to-browser communication using WebRTC, with the server only handling signaling.

**Features:**
- Direct P2P messaging (server never sees content)
- WebRTC data channels
- Room-based chat
- Connection status and latency monitoring
- Polly reactive state for local UI management
- Signaling server (Elysia + WebSocket)

**Great for:**
